## Sonoff-Tasmota
Provide ESP8266 based Sonoff by [iTead Studio](https://www.itead.cc/) and ElectroDragon IoT Relay with Serial, Web and MQTT control allowing 'Over the Air' or OTA firmware updates using Arduino IDE.

Current version is **5.12.0i** - See [sonoff/_releasenotes.ino](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/blob/development/sonoff/_releasenotes.ino) for change information.

### Quick install

Download one of the released binaries from https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/releases and flash it to your hardware as documented in the wiki.

### Important User Compilation Information

If you want to compile Sonoff-Tasmota yourself keep in mind the following:

- Only Flash Mode **DOUT** is supported. Do not use Flash Mode DIO / QIO / QOUT as it might seem to brick your device. See [Wiki](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Theo's-Tasmota-Tips) for background information.
- Sonoff-Tasmota uses a 1M linker script WITHOUT spiffs for optimal code space. If you compile using ESP/Arduino library 2.3.0 then download the provided new linker script to your Arduino IDE or Platformio base folder. Later version of ESP/Arduino library already contain the correct linker script. See [Wiki > Prerequisite](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Prerequisite).
- To make compile time changes to Sonoff-Tasmota it can use the ``user_config_override.h`` file. It assures keeping your settings when you download and compile a new version. To use ``user_config.override.h`` you will have to make a copy of the provided ``user_config.override_sample.h`` file and add your setting overrides. To enable the override file you will need to use a compile define as documented in the ``user_config_override_sample.h`` file.

### Version Information

- Sonoff-Tasmota provides all (Sonoff) modules in one file and starts with module Sonoff Basic.
- Once uploaded select module using the configuration webpage or the commands ```Modules``` and ```Module```.
- After reboot select config menu again or use commands ```GPIOs``` and ```GPIO``` to change GPIO with desired sensor.
